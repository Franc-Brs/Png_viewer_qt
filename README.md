# Png_viewer_qt
very basic image viewer written as a test, work in progress project.

It's possible to open and see a png image, there's a slider for zooming (it's more handy with the keyboard arrows).
There are some tools for really basic image processing, clicking on the image it's possible to get the RGB value of the clicked pixel; by unchecking the R, G, B checkbox it's possible to take to 0 the corresponding channel band.
